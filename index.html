								<p>My participation in Cameras for Conservation on Zooniverse proved to be a more structured yet interpretive experience than I had initially expected.<br>
									After setting up an account, I got to start learning the classification interface, which presents motion triggered camera trap images captured across the American Prairie Reserve in Montana.<br>
									For each image, I had to decide whether any animals were present, identify the species, and estimate the number of individuals visible.<br>
									The instructions seemed clear enough, but the reality of classification turned out to be far more involved than I had expected.<br>
									A significant number of images were captured at night, lit only by infrared, which reduced animals to partial silhouettes or blurred, indistinct shapes.<br> Often, all that was visible was a tail, a pair of eyes, or a faint outline at the edge of the frame. I found myself repeatedly hesitating between similar species, mule deer versus white-tailed deer, for instance.<br>Coming to appreciate just how much accurate identification depends on subtle differences in body shape and proportion.<br> That uncertainty pushed me to slow down and study each frame carefully, rather than defaulting to quick judgements. 
									Gradually, I started picking up on patterns, the posture of the animal, the particular look of their eyes, and the interface itself shaped my thinking, presenting predefined categories that guided how I interpreted each image. I wasn't describing what I saw with my own words, I was slotting the different wildlife into their already established classifications.

								<p>What started out as a straightforward task of spotting animals in photographs quickly turned into a real challenge that required a lot of interpretation, patience, and judgment. It was eye-opening to see how accessible these contributions can be, but it also made me realize just how much mental effort goes into turning simple wildlife images into meaningful conservation data. 

 

The main difficulty I had was distinguishing between mule deer, white tailed deer, and elk, which were the main animals I encountered. As a sociology minor, I found that this experience highlighted an important sociological issue that classification is never straightforward. The platform asks volunteers to fit animals into predefined categories, however, when an animal appears only partially in frame, is moving at night, or is blurred by motion, classifying it often becomes more of an interpretation based on our perspectives rather than a straightforward, objective process. My uncertainty raised questions about data reliability and accuracy. The project addresses this by collecting responses from more than 5000 volunteers to generate statistically reliable results, This shows how other individuals uncertainty can turn into shared understanding when combining everyone's input. Here, knowledge grows not just from experts, but from the diverse perspectives of the many people involved. 
 I encountered some repetition with the same locations appearing many times. This also changed how I understood the project's scale. Early on, the task felt fresh. But after roughly twenty images, I realised I was cycling through a limited set of camera sites, now viewed at different times of day or night. That repetition made the work feel monotonous. It's interesting to consider the difference between how participation is promoted and my actual experience. While the platform makes it seem like being involved is meaningful and engaging, I found myself often doing repetitive and fragmented tasks. I completed small, routine jobs that contributed to a larger research effort. Even though this work was unpaid, I realized it was still very important, as the data I collec  ted could have a real impact on conservation policy. 
At the same time, I found myself struck by how much wildlife appeared across repeated images. A field that showed a small group of cows during the day later revealed a herd of deer moving through the same space at night. When looking at the images over time, it became clear that no single photo could show the full story of how different species coexist and move. 
Seeing cows alongside elk and deer shows some of the politics behind conservation efforts. The American Prairie area is influenced by ranching, private land ownership, and ongoing discussions about rewilding. By noting both livestock and wild animals, volunteers help gather information that can play a role in managing biodiversity and the relationships between people and animals. What might seem like a simple task of identifying species is actually part of a bigger system of learning about the environment. By turning observations into measurable information, we can better track changes in wildlife, recognize patterns in animal behavior, and create effective strategies that respect conservation efforts and human needs. </p>

								<h2 class="major">What i learned</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Participating in Cameras for Conservation really shifted my perspective on skill development and knowledge creation in the digital world. At the start, I struggled with identifying mule deer, white-tailed deer, and elk, especially in those blurry night photos where it was hard to make out their shapes. However, as I progressed through more images, I began to pick up on the different patterns. I started to recognize the unique shape and posture of elk, the distinctive ears of mule deer, and the typical herd behaviors. What once felt like a careful decision-making process gradually became almost second nature. 

This experience showed me how expertise can grow through practice. Although I didn’t have any background in identifying wildlife, my ongoing involvement made me much more confident in my decisions. The platform's clear categories and repeated exposure to similar environments helped me recognize important visual cues over time. This reflects what I believe to be an important idea, instead of relying only on professional researchers, the project empowers volunteers to develop useful skills. Knowledge creation becomes a shared and ongoing process, rather than something exclusive to trained experts. 

Repetition also made the potential challenges of digital crowdsourcing more apparent.On one hand,  Routine classification made it easier for me to make quicker, less considered decisions. On the other hand, Once I realized I was cycling through the same camera locations at different times of day, the task started to feel predictable. As the images repeated, I occasionally felt myself getting tired or slightly bored, and I noticed that this affected the quality of my work.  This experience made me think differently about crowdsourced research. Having lots of volunteers means huge amounts of data can be processed. But, as humans our concentration fades, our energy fluctuates, and we are bound to make mistakes. So the quality of the data depends not only on the crowd, but on the mindset of each individual in that moment. I made this realisation early and It made me feel more responsible for my contribution to the project, the idea that any poor attempts with the classification could negatively impact the data didnt sit right with me.  

 This pointed to a genuine limitation of crowdsourced research.  while volunteer contributions increase scale, they also introduce variability driven by the volunteers attention levels, mood, or exhaustion. Data reliability depends not only on collective consensus, but on the shifting focus of individual contributors. 

The experience was not purely procedural, though. At intervals, I found myself unexpectedly drawn into particular images. One such moment came when I encountered a large herd of deer moving through a field that had repeatedly appeared during daylight hours occupied by cows. The still image conveyed a sense of movement and quiet transition — a landscape shared across species and time. In moments like these, the task moved from classification toward something closer to contemplation. I was no longer simply identifying animals; I was watching an ecological exchange unfold. 

These contrasting modes — monotony and absorption — reveal something significant about digital engagement. Crowdsourced platforms tend to fragment participation into small, repetitive actions, yet the content itself can prompt genuine affective responses. The project shifted between routine labour and moments of environmental awareness, and that tension deepened my understanding of how digital infrastructures shape our relationship with the natural world. The camera trap turns wildlife into data, but it also produces intimate glimpses of ecosystems that would otherwise remain out of reach. 

Through this process, I came to see citizen science as something more than contributing information — it is about cultivating attention. The task called for patience, visual literacy, and honest awareness of my own fatigue. It demonstrated that environmental data is not inherently objective; it emerges from human interpretation, shaped by interface design, repetition, and emotional engagement. Participating in the project broadened my appreciation for how ordinary people can contribute meaningfully to ecological research, while also making visible the cognitive labour concealed within seemingly simple digital tasks. </p>
